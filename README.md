<h1>We Ranked the Purple States of the 2024 US Presidential Election. Here Are The Swingiest States of Them All</h1>

As the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, both Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be paying special attention to wooing voters from the <b>swing states</b>, states which do not consistently vote red (Republican) or blue (Democrat) but rather, often swing from one party to the other, giving them the tag of being <b>purple states</b>.

But which states swing more than others? Even among the purple states, which ones are more purple than others? Can we find out the swingiest or purplest states of them all?

Over the course of this article, we try to quantify the ‘swingy-ness’ of swing states, or the purpleness or purple states. We will look at how often the states have flipped from one party to the other, how close their elections have been, and how recently they have been swinging - all of it, to arrive at a ranking of the swingy-ness of swing states.

<h2>The Methodology</h2>

In deciding how to measure the swingy-ness of a state, we must look at the factors that make up ‘swing’ - 

1. A tendency to have close elections, with <b>narrow victory margins</b>
2. A propensity to <b>flip</b> from one party to another


We made these two factors our metrics for measuring swing.

The most recent presidential election (2020) was given the most weightage and each election before that was progressively given lesser and lesser weightage.

The victory margin percentage between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in 2020 was multiplied by 50.
The victory margin percentage between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in 2016 was multiplied by half of 50, or 25.
The victory margin percentage between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 was multiplied by half of 25, or 12.5.
And so on, till the election in 2000 in which George W. Bush beat Al Gore. The victory margin percentage in that election was multiplied by 1.5625.

The sum of these scores for each state gave the Margin Meter score for that state.

A similar approach was applied for measuring the Flip Meter score. The number of times a state flipped from one party to the other in the presidential elections from 2000 to 2020 was calculated.

If a state flipped in 2020 (compared to 2016), it would get 50 added to its Flip Meter score. If it flipped in 2016 (compared to 2012), it would get half of 50, or 25, added to its score.
A flip in the 2000 election (compared to 1996) would only lead to an addition of 1.5625 to the score.

The sum of these scores for each state gave the Flip Meter score for that state.
